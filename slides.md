# What

A React UI Kit built on Google's official Material Components Web library
---
layout: center
hideInToc: true
---

# Why

* Based on <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web">Google Material Components for the Web</a>
* Avoids breaking changes (at all cost)
* Individually packaged and released components
* Not opinionated on e.g. styling
* How we would have done it on our own üòâ

---

# Alternatives

---
hideInToc: true
---

# Material UI or MUI

* Not based on Google Material Components for the Web
* Many breaking changes üíî
* Opinionated on styling etc.
* Today MUI has better traction than RMWC

---

# History

* Version 1 was released in January 2018
* Created by James Friedman
* Primarily a solo endeavor, truly remarkable
* Adopted by us in May 2018
* Today we have around 10 applications based on RMWC

---

# Abandonment

* Despite internal usage at Google, progress slowed down towards the end of 2020
* Not updated to latest version of Google Material Components for the Web
* Bugs weren't fixed
* Building our applications started to become problematic
* The community wasn't making significant contributions

# Options

---
hideInToc: true
---


# Migrate to MUI
* Large migrating effort
* Bad history of breaking changes
* Not a particular fun job to do

---
hideInToc: true
---

# Start contributing to RMWC
* Fun and exiting
* Might even be cheaper
* Our chance to contribute

---

# The friendly takeover part 1

* We got in contact with James around the beginning of 2022
* His ability to contribute to the project had diminished
* <a href="https://github.com/rmwc/rmwc/issues/758https://github.com/rmwc/rmwc/issues/758">Project Lazarus</a> was started to bring RMWC up to date

# What did we do?

* Weekly meetings
* Establish trust
* Defined a roadmap (Googler Material version 5 ‚û° 8)
* Started working

----
# The friendly takeover part 2

* After a while, it became evident that James couldn't allocate the required time to invest in the project
* RMWC was change from a repo on James's profile into an Github organization
* We ended up with the keys to the kingdom üò®
* We are now working on releasing RMWC version 14 based on Google Material version 14

---

# Challenges

* Getting the needed time
* Corporate Windows setup
* Learning curve
* Yak shaving - toolchain and outdated dependencies

---

# Bennfits

* Fun and energizing
* Career enhancing
* Branding possibilities
* Control and independence
