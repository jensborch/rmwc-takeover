# What

A React UI Kit built on Google's official Material Components Web library

# Why

* Based on <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web">Google Material Components for the Web</a>
* Avoids breaking changes (at all cost)
* Individually packaged and released components
* Not opinionated on e.g. styling
* Accessible
* How we would have done it on our own üòâ

# Alternatives

# Material UI or MUI

* Not based on Google Material Components for the Web
* Many breaking changes üíî
* Opinionated on styling etc.
* Today MUI has better traction than RMWC

# History

* Version 1 was released in January 2018
* Created by James Friedman
* Primarily a solo endeavor, truly remarkable
* Adopted by us in May 2018
* Today we have around 10 applications based on RMWC

# Abandonment

* Despite internal usage at Google, progress slowed down towards the end of 2020
* Not updated to latest version of Google Material Components for the Web
* Bugs weren't fixed
* Building our applications started to become problematic
* The community wasn't making significant contributions

# Migrate to MUI
* Large effort
* Big bang migration or double maintenance
* Bad history of breaking changes
* Not a particular fun job to do

# The friendly takeover part 1

* We got in contact with James around the beginning of 2022
* His ability to contribute to the project had diminished
* <a href="https://github.com/rmwc/rmwc/issues/758https://github.com/rmwc/rmwc/issues/758">Project Lazarus</a> was started to bring RMWC up to date

# The friendly takeover part 2

* After a while, it became evident that James couldn't allocate the required time to invest in the project
* RMWC was changed from a repo on James's profile into an Github organization
* We ended up with the keys to the kingdom üò®üîë
* We are now working on releasing RMWC version 14 based on Google Material version 14
